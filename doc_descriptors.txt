The following descriptors are calculated for each flight phases
and are the following:

for each phase:
	duration
	average air speed
	standard deviation of air speed
	average climb speed
	standard deviation of vertical speed
	max speed
	min speed
	max vertical speed
	min vertical speed
	difference of altitude between the beginning and the end of the phase

for climb phase:

for cruise phase:
	average altitude
	standard deviation of altitude

for descent phase:

All this descriptors are then grouped in one dictionnary which
contain dictionnaries of descriptors for each phase.

Note: there are two altitudes available: geoaltiude and baroaltitude
I use baroaltitude but maybe it is better to use geoaltitude.
